            <h4>The Importance of Creating a Culture of Data</h4>
            <br>
            <p>The linked blog post speaks to the importance of creating a culture of data.</p>
             <p>Firstly, artificial intelligence, or AI for short, is a wide ranging branch of computer science which is concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks which would typically require human intelligence. <p> 
             <p>It is to be noted that artificial intelligence requires machine learning and machine learning requires analytics. To work with analytics effectively, elegant data or information architecture (IA) is needed. </p>
			 <p>When using artificial intelligence, the real success comes down to the organization's ability to adopt a culture which is focused or centered on data as a culture can be one an extremely powerful asset or an obstruction for a company or organization.</p>
			 <br>
			 <p>"Every organization that aspires to a data culture has to pick a place to start. Deep learning will make data accessible that previously was not; if that will create momentum, with a high chance of success, that is where you should start. For other organizations, better predictions and automation will beget a data culture. Regardless of which path you choose, the objective is the same: do data science faster."</p>
