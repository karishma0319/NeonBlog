            <h4><i>BEES!</i></h4>
            <br>
            <p>The linked blog post speaks to the importance of bees on the environment around us.</p>
             <p><i>"The impact bees have on our environment is undeniable but not always obvious.</i> <p> 
             <p>It should be noted that bees are responsible for one in every three bites of food humans consume. Bees serve as pollinators in the first instance, but they also serve as creators of honey, propolis, pollen, habitants for other species as well as food for larger species in the ecosystem. </p>
			 <p>The honey produced by bees are used by humans for culinary purposes. Adding to this, humans also take advantage of the antimicrobial properties of propolis which is a natural resinous mixture produced by honey bees from substances collected from parts of plants, buds and exudates. </p>
			 <p>Native bees on the other hand are considered to be three times more efficient at pollinating when compared to honey bees and the trickle-down effect of flora pollination reaches all the way to the air and water quality of the environment which everyone benefits from in a time of high pollution.</p>
			 <br>
			 <p>In short, it can be said that bees and the environment formed a unique marriage together at the beginning ot time as you cannot have a healthy environment without bees and bees cannot thrive without a healthy environment.</p>
